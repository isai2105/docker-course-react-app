# Just by adding a From statement, Docker understand that the previous phase terminates as soon as this starts
FROM nginx
# This does nothing on local or dev environments
# AWS Elastic Beanstalk maps this port when finding the following config
EXPOSE 80
# /app/build is where things get created in the previous step
# Accodring to the Nginx documentation, anything inside '/usr/share/nginx/html' will be served automatically
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
# IMPORTANT: The default start command of Nginx is the one we need, so we do not specify it here.
